2 i 162


answer stored in rax? 

i e U 


3


49 i 


What we know: 

Format: 
Digit Character Digit

After scanning the input, it checks if %eax is less than two. In other words, checking to see if you input 3 characters: digit, character, digit. 


Then, the program checks to see if the first digit is greater than 7. Considering it is, it explodes the bomb. 


After storing that information, the program then jumps to $rax, 163. 


Then moves 72 into $eax, 114 in decimal

the compares 23c to 14rsp, 

correct address to examine: 0x7fffffffe984, 0xa2: 162 in decimal. that was my input. 
comaring this against: 572 in decimal. 


So I'm going to add that to my answers.txt then try to get to the same point I was at to continue the rev

I MADE IT !!!


Now im fighting with %al, 0xf(%rsp)
