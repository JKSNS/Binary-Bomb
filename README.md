## Overview

The **Binary Bomb** is a reverse-engineering challenge designed to test your understanding of debugging, disassembling, and analyzing binary executables. This challenge involves defusing a "bomb" by carefully analyzing and understanding the behavior of a given binary file to input the correct answers in each phase.

## Tools Needed

To successfully defuse the bomb, you will need the following tools:

- **GNU Debugger (gdb)**: For step-by-step execution and inspection of binary code.
- **objdump**: To disassemble the binary and analyze the assembly code.
- **strings**: To find readable strings within the binary.
- **hexeditor**: (optional) To view and manipulate the binary at the byte level.

## Understanding the Binary Bomb

The **Binary Bomb** consists of several phases, each requiring a specific input to pass. If the wrong input is entered, the bomb "explodes," and you need to start again. The goal is to defuse the bomb by figuring out the correct inputs for each phase.

## Phase-by-Phase Solutions




## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing each phase, understanding the disassembled code, and using debugging tools, we successfully defused the **Binary Bomb**. The challenge provides valuable hands-on experience with reverse engineering, debugging, and understanding low-level code execution.

Feel free to explore the repository further and try your own approaches to defuse the bomb!

Happy defusing!
